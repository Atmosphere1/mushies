      <h1>Tomatoes</h1>
      <p>Let me take a guess... You have already heard about the legendary word "tomato", sometimes in its plural form, which is "tomatoes". Tomato is a famous fruit, with glossy red skin, occasionally yellow or purple covering the watery, pulpy flesh. It originated from Central and South America. The fruit's scientific name is "Solanum lycopersicum", which isn't as popular as its appealing, short name "tomato". Tomatoes are widely consumed by people all over the world. They also vary in size, color, shape and taste. Today, we're going to discover some of the most well-known tomato varieties. Let's hop right in!</p>

      <h2>Early Girl</h2>
      <p>One of the most popular varieties of tomatoes. It originated in France as a hybrid tomato, distributed in the U.S. in the late 1970s by PetoSeed company. The ripe fruit is red, about the size of a tennis ball, weighing about 110 - 230g. Early Girl tomatoes taste like tomatoes (obviously) with the acidity and sweetness balanced, sometimes a hint of tang.</p>
